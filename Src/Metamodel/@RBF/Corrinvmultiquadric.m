% CORRINVMULTIQUADRIC 
%   Inverse multiquadric radial function
%   - diff_mat is the matrix of squared manhattan distance
%   - theta is the correlation length parameter
%
%   - corr_mat is the correlation matrix
%   - f_mat is the polynomial matrix
%   - zero mat is the zero matrix
%   Those variables are used in the system to solve for obtaining RBF parameters
